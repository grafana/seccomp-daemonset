# Profiles should be an object of files to load.
# The key is the name of the profile file relative to the `profileDirectory` value.
# The value is the content of the file; it should be a valid seccomp profile in JSON format.
# If not set, no profiles will be loaded, but the DaemonSet will still exist and run the pods.
#
# Keys here MUST NOT begin with two dots (..), otherwise they will be ignored. This is because Kubernetes
# uses this prefix in the mounts, and we ignore the files entirely.
